# My-Library
A library app following I made as a project to learn the basics of JavaScript & HTML.

The clean and beautiful layout is thanks to Skeleton.

## **Live**
A live deployment of [`My Library`](https://dekateshantanu015.github.io/My-Library/) is available on GitHub pages, check it out without need of installation

## Requirements
- A render() function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page
- A form that allows user to add new books
- A delete button.
- A button to handle the read status of the book

## Object Constructors
The focus of this project was to create this app using Object Constructors and being able to reduce the code by doing so.

## LocalStorage
I was asked to do it locally but it was a fine opportunity to learn and apply LocalStorage. I learned about the basics of it using the Mozilla documentation and also learned about JSON stringify and parse methods which made handling the data extremely easy.
